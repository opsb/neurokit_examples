    "  - **Alpha** (8-13 Hz): Strongest in the occipital areas at the back of the scalp (visual cortex). Alpha power is assumed to be inversely related to cortical activation. Alpha power could be regarded as an index of top-down processing, representing a mechanism for increasing the signal-to-noise ratio.\n",
    "  - **Mu** (9-11 Hz): The mu rhythm can be found in the frontoparietal region: over the motor cortex, in a band approximately from ear to ear.\n",
    "  - **Theta** (4-8 Hz): Midline theta is usually maximal in the frontal or fronto-central regions.\n",

The EEG power spectrum is dominantly structured by a decreasing function with lower power at higher frequencies that approximates a **1/f pattern** (Pritchard, 1992; Voytek et al., 2015). There is an inverse relationship between frequency and power, and the steepness with which the power drops off as the frequency gets higher is represented by the exponent γ.\n",

    "Estimation of the 1/f exponent γ (Voytek et al., 2015) provides a consolidated view of the differences across bands and can be used to compute the difference between any two frequencies if desired. The 1/f decay exponent is best estimated in the range of 2–30 Hz where baseline drifts, line noise and distortions introduced by band pass filters have the least impact (Newson, 2019).\n"
